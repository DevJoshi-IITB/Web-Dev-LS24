                <h1>Chess</h1>
                <p>
                    Chess is a two-player strategy board game that has been
                    played for centuries, originating in India around the 6th
                    century. The game is played on an 8x8 grid with each player
                    controlling 16 pieces: King, Queen, Rooks, Knights, Bishops,
                    and Pawns, each with unique movements. The objective is to
                    checkmate the opponent's king, meaning it is under threat of
                    capture with no legal moves to escape. Chess involves
                    strategic planning, tactical maneuvers, and deep thinking,
                    making it a timeless and intellectually stimulating game
                    enjoyed by millions worldwide.
